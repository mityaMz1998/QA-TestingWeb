1.Suppose you are testing a project that combines a web service and a mobile application.
You have the following funcionality:
-Recording a video (in the mobile app);
-Uploading the recorded video to the web service (in the mobile app);
-Edit the name of the uploaded video on the web service page in the browser.
(text field and 2 buttons: "Save" and "Cancel").
It is necessary to write a list of tests (in the form of a check-list), which you would use to test this functionality.

2.Situation: There is a web form for sending a link to a video (the email field and the send button).
The user enters email, clicks on the "Send" button, then the recipient receives an email with a link,
clicking on it opens a window with a video that can be played.
Think of a few bugs and describe them in the form of bug reports

3.Describe when you think product testing should be stopped?
